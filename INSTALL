BAli-Phy

*Requirements*

BAli-Phy relies only on a modern C++ compiler and the GSL library.
GCC will work if it is version 3.4.0 or higher.

*Compilation*

The makefiles provided require GNU make.  They also assumes that the
compiler is called 'g++-3.4'.  To change this, or to change other
compilation options, edit the makefile src/GNUmakefile.

In order to compile the program on UNIX, simply enter the src/
directory and type 'make' at the shell prompt. This will produce an
executable called 'bali-phy'.  To generate a faster executuable you
can instead type 

% ARCH=pentium4 make
       or
% ARCH=athlon-xp' make

To compile both bali-phy and associated tools (which is recommended)
instead specify 'make install'.  This will compile bali-phy and the 
tools, and will copy them both to the bali-phy-<VERSION>/bin/ directory.

*Windows and Mac platforms*
On windows, this may work with in the cygwin environment, which
emulates a UNIX environment.

On MacOSX, this procedure may need to be modified slightly.  By using
the 'Fink' system, you can probably install GNU make.


*Final Installation*

It is recommended that you make both bali-phy and the tools, as described
above.  You must then copy these tools into a directory in your path, or
add the bali-phy ./bin directory to your path.  In addition, it is recommended
that you make a bali-phy/ directory, and copy the bali-phy executable to the
location bali-phy/<VERSION>-NDEBUG.  This will allow the ./bin/sampler.sh script
to use your executable in the SGE (sun grid engine) environment.
