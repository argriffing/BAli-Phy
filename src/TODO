TODO 
 - fix bandwidth code...
 - speed up branch length calculations - 
 - CHECK acceptance/rejection ratios - alter things.
 - profile DEBUG vs NDEBUG, make DEBUG faster
 - profile NDEBUG code to see where we are spending (in each data set!)
 - truncate ends of EF-Tu/48a.fasta sequences?
 - we can get a factor-of-3 speedup by
   + running tree_moves once instead of twice per iteration
   + running length_moves once instead of twice per tree_move
   + running only 1+B/3 branch adjustments per length_moves
