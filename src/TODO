1. Make tree-dist-compare consider all partitions w/ PP > 0.5

2. Estimate best alignment by finding the alignment with the greatest
   sum of PP(i ~ j) for all aligned pairs (i,j);

3. boost::program_options

4. Make alignment-draw be able to output EPS

5. implement: new framework for fixing things
	a) disable=alignment 
	a) disable=alignment
	b) disable=tree
	c) disable=frequencies

6. Debugging framework - test on other platforms
   Also, try with stlport again
   Also, compare some things with mrbayes, bambe

check: how does P(data|model) depend on number of frequency bins?

fix: gamma+frequency+INV

model: Make INV categories depend on letters, somehow...

sample lengths/topologies MORE often when alignment sampling also?

A new ggobi is available!  Try multidimensional scaling...

Start proposing INV::p on the log odds scale.
It is OK to change the prior, because we never want to use it
differently.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[FIXED] s-parameters aren't accepted/sampled often enough.

[FIXED] implement: 'f' parameter in ReversibleMarkov models

[FIXED] check: memory usage -> EF-Tu/12d ~ 120 Mb RAM ?
        (memory usage decreased)

[DONE]  make a separate DEBUG_CACHING

[DONE]  make change_parameters() debugging code call a function which output
        substitution parameters.

[DONE]  allow comments in the alignment constraint file, and make
        the alignment index program spit out the actual letters for each
        column as comments.
