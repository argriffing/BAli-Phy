check: how does P(data|model) depend on number of frequency bins?

implement: 'f' parameter in ReversibleMarkov models

fix: gamma+frequency+INV

model: Make INV categories depend on letters, somehow...

fix: s-parameters aren't accepted/sampled often enough.

sample lengths/topologies MORE often when alignment sampling also?

fix: make change_parameters() debugging code call a function which output
     substitution parameters.

fix: we really need to start proposing INV::p on the log odds scale.
     It is OK to change the prior, because we never want to use it
     differently.

debug: we also want to guard each routine with assert(letters_ok(A)) on
       both sides so that we can figure out where the problem is coming
       from.

debug: check 48-D-? for strange rejections.  Why is the probability
decreasing so much, when it should increase? (turn on debugging for
this step, but disable debugging of caching) 

debug: make a separate DEBUG_SUBST.

implement: allow comments in the alignment constraint file, and make
the alignment index program spit out the actual letters for each
column as comments. 

make tree-dist-compare consider all partitions, not just the MAP tree.
(perhaps just all OBSERVED partitions?)

A new ggobi is available!  Try multidimensional scaling...
