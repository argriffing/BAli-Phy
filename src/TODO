10. Speed up sample_path() for DParrayConstrained by only considering
    allowed states for each column...
    a) check how fast we are when gaps=full_tree but alignment_branch is 
       fixed... 
    b) remove invalidation in 3way and 5way sampling... 
    c) see how much speed gain we get for 48 taxa...

-2. consider ignoring letters if they are wildcards...

-1.  Add comments!

0. Update tools directory to use boost::program_options.

1. Get intel compiler

2. Fix setting of 'fixed' flags in model.H/C, allow 'unfixing' flags.

3. Why did I think that I needed to invalidate branches on sample_nodes
   again?
   a) well, the INDEXING from alignment to conditional likelihood changes.
      but we recompute that anyway.

   b) the representation that we have depends only on the leaves

    * the problem is that ORDER of columns changes!  So, if LC(b,*) is 
      constructed from LC(b1,*) and LC(b2,*), I need a way of
      specifying the order of (-,+) and (+,-) columns that is
      independant of the alignment in order for sample_nodes not to
      affect LC(b,*).  

    * we can depend on the topologies of the subtrees under b1 and b2,
      because if one of them changed, it would be invalidated anyway,
      and thus so would b.  So, we could sort b1,..bn in increasing
      order by their first leaf node.  Then we would have a way of
      ordering columns that truly depends only on the leaves.

    * the presence of wildcard characters does affect the ordering.

    * in order to make subA_index order independant of A order, we have to
      a) sort the columns of subA_index
      b) be able to compute the columns of subA_index from the SORTED columns
	 of the branch subAs...

   Write in paper: we need a method for caching likelihood frequencies
   that does not depend on features of the alignment, like column
   number that may change w/o changing the conditional likelihoods.

4. Record when each constraint is first satisfied, as well as x/y constraints satisfied.
5. Make align-constraint= work with sample_tri_multi (there is no regular sample_multi)
6. Make A3-stripped.fasta work with alphabet=Codons
   a) smodel parameters aren't being sampled??
   b) we could also implement models besides M0...

7. tree-dist-compare: 
	a) by default, only show 1 topology per file
	b) allow consensus to take a comma-separated list of values
	c) 
8. Make alignment-draw simply use 'plain' (or something) if AU-file
    not specified.

9. write code to load joint (A,T) distributions...

11.5: Write simple MPI code for MCMCMC....

12. Clean up ColorMap-s in alignment-draw, and sanitize naming scheme.
    a) put all colormaps on the same scale by making colormaps nested
       and colorschemes not nested.
    b) allow names like colorscheme=plain+AA+whiten scale=LOD
                        colorscheme=plain-AA-whiten scale=LOD
       where minus means affect the fg instead of the background.

13. How to make priors specified on command line?

14. Debugging framework 
   a) platforms
     1) intel c++
     2) cygwin
     3) MS Visual C++
  b) stlport
  c) compare
     1) MrBayes
     2) bambe
     3) BEAST

15. Make alignment-draw be able to output EPS

16. how does P(data|model) depend on number of frequency bins?

17. Allow alignment to contain only 2 sequences?

18. Find a better distance measure for alignment-median?

19. implement: new framework for fixing things
	a) disable=alignment  -> fixed=A fixed=alignment
	b) disable=alignment_branch -> fixed=A- fixed=leaves-alignment
	c) disable=tree             -> fixed=tau fixed=topology
	d) disable=frequencies      -> fixed=pi  fixed=frequencies

A. fix: gamma+frequency+INV

B. model: Make INV categories depend on letters, somehow...

C. sample lengths/topologies MORE often when alignment sampling also?

D. A new ggobi is available!  Try multidimensional scaling...

E. Start proposing INV::p on the log odds scale. It is OK to change
the prior, because we never want to use it  differently.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[FIXED] s-parameters aren't accepted/sampled often enough.

[FIXED] implement: 'f' parameter in ReversibleMarkov models

[FIXED] check: memory usage -> EF-Tu/12d ~ 120 Mb RAM ?
        (memory usage decreased)

[DONE]  make a separate DEBUG_CACHING

[DONE]  make change_parameters() debugging code call a function which output
        substitution parameters.

[DONE]  allow comments in the alignment constraint file, and make
        the alignment index program spit out the actual letters for each
        column as comments. 

[DONE]  Make tree-dist-compare consider all partitions w/ PP > 0.5

[DONE]  Stop using PHYLIP.  Dealing with truncated names is too painful!

[DONE]  alignment-gild: use list<alignment> instead of vector<>...

[DONE]  alignment-draw: implement bg-colors=type, bg-whiteness = uncertainty

[DONE]  Use boost::program_options and remove arguments.{H,C}

[DONE]  Estimate best alignment by finding the alignment with the greatest
   sum of PP(i ~ j) for all aligned pairs (i,j);

[DONE]  Fix "showonly" - think of better name.
