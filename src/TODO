-10. WRite paper!

-9. Indel model...

-8. Standardized checks for indexing problems, in sample-node, f.e.
    a) standard check for altered index patterns
    b) (?) also check for change in likelihood - unset cached_value_up-to-date
       somehow

-7. convert Pr_sum_all_paths( ) and other stuff to efloat_t?
    a) simplifies implementation of choose( )...
    b) allows us to get rid of choose_log( ) which gives a speedup for le_double_t.

-6. Do we want to hard-code the concepts of transition kernels and priors
    into models?  Each can have parameters...

-5. Find a way to allow substitution models to propose a lot of different
    changes each time we try to propose new parameters.
    a) ask the model for a number of fiddles to do, and then do
    b) for(int i=0;i<n_fiddles;i++) {
         smodel = smodel2
         smodel2->fiddle(i)
         accept/reject(smodel,smodel2)
       }
    c) some kind of interface for non-symmetric proposals?

-4. Make a more general substitution::Model class, so that we can e.g.
    have tree with 2 sets of branch lengths...

-3. Start making some "nice" pictures to put up on the website.
    a) include pictures to give to Dr. Lake's lab
    b) include pictures to give to Dr. Sabatti

-2. tree-dist-compare w/ sub-partitions
  a) test bacteria run under INV+gamma...
  b) test Kallikrein - which one had a wandering taxon.  
  c) add switch '--bootstrap' to make bootstraps optional

-1. Run with mudflap...
  a) alter GNUmakefile so that building w/ mudflap is easy.

0. Don't spend so much time initializing:
[HARD]
  a) 10% - DPmatrixEmit::DPmatrix: try to remove unneeded initialization or speed it up.
     - initialize as we go forward
     - for DPmatrixConstrained, this means that we need to ignore states on
       backsampling if we don't initialize cells on the forward pass

  b) speed up forward_cell by putting a boundary around the matrix :)

[EASY] - check for more!
  c) do vector<double>'s always INITIALIZE them all to zero? 
      Why does choose<double>( ) call std::fill_n( )?
  d) DPmatrix::sample_path() const [42] -> spends HALF its time in vector<double>::vector(int) ?
  e) how does createQ spend so much of its time NOT in getQ?
  f) why aren't we inlining vector<int>::operator[]  [49]?
  g) we spend 21% of substitution time in subA_index
  h) compare times w/ g++-4.0 times...  after improving the code a bit more.
  i) check w/ fp_scale::cutoff = 1.0e-1 ? or 1.0e-10?
                 

1. test fix for crashing bug.
   a) we could try to cache some of the results from ordering branches
      under this branch.
   b) we could just compute the full order w/ what we have now.

*2. MCMCMC
    a) Make the temperature affect only the likelihood...
    b) test speedups...
    c) begin to implement the forking code / temperature identifier.
    d) begin to implement the separate random number generators.

3. Report partitions that results from unplugging one branch at each node....

*4. Write alignment-consensus

5. Add comments!

6. consider ignoring letters if they are wildcards...

7: Change YangCodonModel to YangM0? (short name)
   a) split smodel.H/C into several files?

8: Allow specifying another model than HKY (e.g. TNY) 
      underneath YangCodonModel.  
	* This is difficult because the models have different alphabets
	* Suppose we wanted HKY+YangM0+TNY+YangM0+Dual

------
*13. How to make priors specified on command line?

14. Debugging framework 
   a) platforms
     1) intel c++
     2) cygwin
     3) MS Visual C++
  b) stlport
  c) compare
     1) MrBayes
     2) bambe
     3) BEAST

*15. Make alignment-draw be able to output EPS

16. how does P(data|model) depend on number of frequency bins?

17. Allow alignment to contain only 2 sequences?

18. Find a better distance measure for alignment-median?

*19. implement: new framework for fixing things
	a) disable=alignment  -> fixed=A fixed=alignment
	b) disable=alignment_branch -> fixed=A- fixed=leaves-alignment
	c) disable=tree             -> fixed=tau fixed=topology
	d) disable=frequencies      -> fixed=pi  fixed=frequencies

A. fix: gamma+frequency+INV

B. model: Make INV categories depend on letters, somehow...

C. sample lengths/topologies MORE often when alignment sampling also?

D. A new ggobi is available!  Try multidimensional scaling...

E. Start proposing INV::p on the log odds scale. It is OK to change
the prior, because we never want to use it  differently.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[FIXED] s-parameters aren't accepted/sampled often enough.

        column as comments. 

[DONE]  Make tree-dist-compare consider all partitions w/ PP > 0.5

[DONE]  Fix setting of 'fixed' flags in model.H/C, to allow 'unfixing' parameters
        and also modifying fixed/unfixed for sub-models.

    * sum_l a(m,l) = 1
    * distribution(m) = sum_; a(m,l)*f(l)
    * f(m,l) = a(m,l) * f(l) / distribution(m)
    * two moves:
      - fiddle frequencies (as normal)
      - fiddle each row (one letter, all models)
    * prior -> each row is dirichlet
