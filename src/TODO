-3. Plot #topologies in confidence interval (0,p) vs p. (e.g. sort topologies)
    Then plot this versus time...

    Also compare this between runs...

    Figure out burnin for bacteria data sets...

1. Reduce memory usage:
 a) don't store 1 DPmatrix at a time... - free memory afterwards unless debugging
 b) use FastLSA algorithm to change memory usage to O(N+M)*k instead of O(N*M)

2. Try with STLport, mudflap, valgrind, etc.
  a) STLport could actually give us a speedup!

3. Indel model - fix so that prior probabilities exist!

4. Start making some "nice" pictures to put up on the website.
    a) include pictures to give to Dr. Lake's lab
    b) include pictures to give to Dr. Sabatti

*5. MCMCMC
    a) Make the temperature affect only the likelihood...
    b) test speedups...
    c) begin to implement the forking code / temperature identifier.
    d) begin to implement the separate random number generators.

6. Make a more general substitution::Model class, so that we can e.g.
    have tree with 2 sets of branch lengths...

*7. Write alignment-consensus

8. Add partitions from M[0.5] to M[l] if they are revealed by deleting subtrees.
   a) also mark "badly-rooted" subtrees?  (edges are hidden because of badly-rooted-ness?)

9: Allow specifying another model than HKY (e.g. TNY) 
      underneath YangCodonModel.  
	* This is difficult because the models have different alphabets
	* Suppose we wanted HKY+YangM0+TNY+YangM0+Dual

10. Find a way to allow substitution models to propose a lot of different
    changes each time we try to propose new parameters.
    a) ask the model for a number of fiddles to do, and then do
    b) for(int i=0;i<n_fiddles;i++) {
         smodel = smodel2
         smodel2->fiddle(i)
         accept/reject(smodel,smodel2)
       }
    c) some kind of interface for non-symmetric proposals?

------
A. sub-partitions: 

*B. How to make priors specified on command line?

C. Debugging framework 
   a) platforms
     1) intel c++
     2) cygwin
     3) MS Visual C++
  b) stlport
  c) compare
     1) MrBayes
     2) bambe
     3) BEAST
  d) mudflap -> alter GNUmakefile so that this is easy

*D. Make alignment-draw be able to output EPS

E. how does P(data|model) depend on number of frequency bins?

F. Allow alignment to contain only 2 sequences?

G. Find a better distance measure for alignment-median?

*H. implement: new framework for fixing things
	a) disable=alignment  -> fixed=A fixed=alignment
	b) disable=alignment_branch -> fixed=A- fixed=leaves-alignment
	c) disable=tree             -> fixed=tau fixed=topology
	d) disable=frequencies      -> fixed=pi  fixed=frequencies

------------------------------



I. fix: gamma+frequency+INV

II. model: Make INV categories depend on letters, somehow...

III. sample lengths/topologies MORE often when alignment sampling also?

IV. A new ggobi is available!  Try multidimensional scaling...

V. Start proposing INV::p on the log odds scale. It is OK to change
the prior, because we never want to use it  differently.

        column as comments. 

[DONE]  Make tree-dist-compare consider all partitions w/ PP > 0.5

[DONE]  Fix "showonly" - think of better name. (urgh - picked show-only)

[DONE]  Fix setting of 'fixed' flags in model.H/C, to allow 'unfixing' parameters
        and also modifying fixed/unfixed for sub-models.

	b) allow consensus to take a comma-separated list of values

[DONE] add '--first' and '--last' arguments to alignment-find

[DONE] Update tools to use boost::program_options.

    * frequency will be the frequency of the sub-model.
    * sum_l a(m,l) = 1
    * distribution(m) = sum_; a(m,l)*f(l)
    * f(m,l) = a(m,l) * f(l) / distribution(m)
    * two moves:
      - fiddle frequencies (as normal)
      - fiddle each row (one letter, all models)
    * prior -> each row is dirichlet

[DONE] 	Integrating joint-A-T and the 'hack' to set indel prior parameters.

        
[DONE] Report constraints satisfied by initial alignment/tree.

[DONE] Rename YangCodonModel to YangM0

[DONE] Using regular FP math for DP, with a scaling factor per cell.
       * move created of std::vector< > temporary variables out of loops.
       * switched to using std::valarray< > instead of std::vector< > 
         for state_{array,matrix}
       * inlined di,dj,dk,dl,dc in 3way.H from 3way.C

[DONE] DPmatrix speedup - phase 2
       * add a boundary, and shift everything by (+1,+1)
       i then we can remove check to optionally break out of the inner loop
       * side effect is that we initialize as we go, even states whose predecessor
         is out of the square.
       * initialize boundaries in forward_square, with special case for (1,1)=S(0,0)
       * special case sample_path() for DPmatrixConstrained( ) because we don't initialize
         illegeal state / location pairs.
      ii REMOVE THE FULL INITIALIZATION in DPmatrix::DPmatrix( )!

       Also:
       * shift s1_sub, s2_sub, s12_sub to matrix coordinates by adding padding to the beginning.

[DONE] Fix sub-alignment indices
  a) make A?::construct reconstruct subA indices
     - indices are uniquely defined - reconstructing from scratch
       should not change them.
     - indices are dependant only on leaf-taxa alignment & tree
  b) reconstruct subA indices when tree changes 
     - sample-tri.C for sample-topology-SPR.C
