-6. Do we want to hard-code the concepts of transition kernels and priors
    into models?  Each can have parameters...

-5. Find a way to allow substitution models to propose a lot of different
    changes each time we try to propose new parameters.

-4. Make a more general substitution::Model class, so that we can e.g.
    have tree with 2 sets of branch lengths...

-3. Better multi_freq model.  
    * The frequency of the underlying model will be the frequency of the
      whole model.
    * f(m,i) = a(m,i) * f(i)
    * sum_i a(m,i) = 1
    * sum_m a(m,i) = distribution(m) / |alphabet|
    * two moves
      - i.  change a(m,i) for a single m.  
	ii. Scale the other entries in each row so that row still sums to 1.

      - i.   get distributions from a(m,i)
        ii.  dirichlet_fiddle it.
        iii. put it back
    * prior = each row is dirichlet

    * make a dual-mode which is a sum of the unit mode and the multi_freq
      model
        
Base each of the submodels on the frequency
    of the underlying model.  Each submodel has n parameters a_{mi} so that
    \pi_{mi} = f_i*a_{mi}/max_i a{m_i}.  Then let a_i be dirichlet...

    * 

-2. tree-dist-compare w/ sub-partitions
  a) speed up get_Ml_partitions, get_Ml_sub_partitions
  b) only enable sub-partition checking with a switch..
  c) arrange 
  d) test Kallikrein - which one had a wandering taxon.  
  e) also test SIV?
  f) switch --sub-partitions?  --bootstrap?

-1. fix crashing bug... hopefully.

0. merge marc's code

1. Call report_constraints(v1,v2) where v1 is all false, before starting
   the iterations.  Then we will know how many of the constraints are
   satisfied.
2. Don't report any constraints if the number of constraints is zero.

3. Report partitions that results from unplugging one branch at each node....

*4. Write alignment-consensus

5. Add comments!

10. write code to load joint (A,T) distributions...

*11: Write simple MPI code for MCMCMC....
   a) FIX problem where 1/(1-Q(z,z)) is NEGATIVE.

3. Speed up sample_path() for DParrayConstrained by only considering
    allowed states for each column...
    a) benchmark gaps=full_tree when alignment_branch is fixed... 
    c) see how much speed gain we get for 48 taxa...

4. consider ignoring letters if they are wildcards...

12: Change YangCodonModel to YangM0? (short name)

12.5: Allow specifying another model than HKY (e.g. TNY) underneath YangCodonModel
------
*13. How to make priors specified on command line?

14. Debugging framework 
   a) platforms
     1) intel c++
     2) cygwin
     3) MS Visual C++
  b) stlport
  c) compare
     1) MrBayes
     2) bambe
     3) BEAST

*15. Make alignment-draw be able to output EPS

16. how does P(data|model) depend on number of frequency bins?

17. Allow alignment to contain only 2 sequences?

18. Find a better distance measure for alignment-median?

*19. implement: new framework for fixing things
	a) disable=alignment  -> fixed=A fixed=alignment
	b) disable=alignment_branch -> fixed=A- fixed=leaves-alignment
	c) disable=tree             -> fixed=tau fixed=topology
	d) disable=frequencies      -> fixed=pi  fixed=frequencies

A. fix: gamma+frequency+INV

B. model: Make INV categories depend on letters, somehow...

C. sample lengths/topologies MORE often when alignment sampling also?

D. A new ggobi is available!  Try multidimensional scaling...

E. Start proposing INV::p on the log odds scale. It is OK to change
the prior, because we never want to use it  differently.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[FIXED] s-parameters aren't accepted/sampled often enough.

[FIXED] implement: 'f' parameter in ReversibleMarkov models

[DONE]  make a separate DEBUG_CACHING

[DONE]  make change_parameters() debugging code call a function which output
        substitution parameters.
