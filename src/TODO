1. Update tools directory to use boost::program_options.

2. Fix tools/analyze-distances: make an interface to get likelihoods by column...

*3. Write alignment-consensus

4. In smodel description, allow a * argument, or perhaps a [] format so -> 
   a) Empirical[WAG] + gamma[4] + 
   b) or just WAG + gamma[4]
   c) or [WAG] + gamma[4]

5. Add comments!

*6. Record when each constraint is first satisfied, as well as x/y constraints satisfied.
*7. Make align-constraint= work with sample_tri_multi (there is no regular sample_multi)

8. Get intel compiler

9. Make alignment-draw simply use 'plain' (or something) if AU-file
    not specified.

10. write code to load joint (A,T) distributions...

12. Clean up ColorMap-s in alignment-draw, and sanitize naming scheme.
    a) put all colormaps on the same scale by making colormaps nested
       and colorschemes not nested.
    b) allow names like colorscheme=plain+AA+whiten scale=LOD
                        colorscheme=plain-AA-whiten scale=LOD
       where minus means affect the fg instead of the background.
    b.1) start out by making everything affect only the background. 
	 We can just use switch for now, right?

*11: Write simple MPI code for MCMCMC....
   a) FIX problem where 1/(1-Q(z,z)) is NEGATIVE.

3. Speed up sample_path() for DParrayConstrained by only considering
    allowed states for each column...
    a) benchmark gaps=full_tree when alignment_branch is fixed... 
    c) see how much speed gain we get for 48 taxa...

4. consider ignoring letters if they are wildcards...
    a) first 

12.5: Allow specifying another model than HKY (e.g. TNY) underneath YangCodonModel
------
*13. How to make priors specified on command line?

14. Debugging framework 
   a) platforms
     1) intel c++
     2) cygwin
     3) MS Visual C++
  b) stlport
  c) compare
     1) MrBayes
     2) bambe
     3) BEAST

*15. Make alignment-draw be able to output EPS

16. how does P(data|model) depend on number of frequency bins?

17. Allow alignment to contain only 2 sequences?

18. Find a better distance measure for alignment-median?

19. implement: new framework for fixing things
	a) disable=alignment  -> fixed=A fixed=alignment
	b) disable=alignment_branch -> fixed=A- fixed=leaves-alignment
	c) disable=tree             -> fixed=tau fixed=topology
	d) disable=frequencies      -> fixed=pi  fixed=frequencies

A. fix: gamma+frequency+INV

B. model: Make INV categories depend on letters, somehow...

C. sample lengths/topologies MORE often when alignment sampling also?

D. A new ggobi is available!  Try multidimensional scaling...

E. Start proposing INV::p on the log odds scale. It is OK to change
the prior, because we never want to use it  differently.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[FIXED] s-parameters aren't accepted/sampled often enough.

[FIXED] implement: 'f' parameter in ReversibleMarkov models

[FIXED] check: memory usage -> EF-Tu/12d ~ 120 Mb RAM ?
        (memory usage decreased)

[DONE]  make a separate DEBUG_CACHING

[DONE]  make change_parameters() debugging code call a function which output
        substitution parameters.

[DONE]  allow comments in the alignment constraint file, and make
        the alignment index program spit out the actual letters for each
        column as comments. 

[DONE]  Make tree-dist-compare consider all partitions w/ PP > 0.5

[DONE]  Stop using PHYLIP.  Dealing with truncated names is too painful!

[DONE]  alignment-gild: use list<alignment> instead of vector<>...

[DONE]  alignment-draw: implement bg-colors=type, bg-whiteness = uncertainty

[DONE]  Use boost::program_options and remove arguments.{H,C}

[DONE]  Estimate best alignment by finding the alignment with the greatest
   sum of PP(i ~ j) for all aligned pairs (i,j);

[DONE]  Fix "showonly" - think of better name. (urgh - picked show-only)

[DONE]  Fix setting of 'fixed' flags in model.H/C, to allow 'unfixing' parameters
        and also modifying fixed/unfixed for sub-models.

[DONE]  Fix smodel parameters aren't being sampled.

[DONE]  Make A3-stripped.fasta work with alphabet=Codons

[DONE]  Implement YangM2

[DONE]  Stop requiring --random-tree-ok


[DONE]  Implement sorting of subA columns to provide stable names when columns are re-ordered.
[DONE]  Remove invalidation in 3way sampling, 5way sampling, and tri-sampling.

[DONE]  tree-dist-compare: 
	a) by default, only show 1 topology per file
	b) allow consensus to take a comma-separated list of values

[DONE] add '--first' and '--last' arguments to alignment-find
