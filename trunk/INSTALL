BAli-Phy

*Requirements*

BAli-Phy relies only on a modern C++ compiler and the GSL library.
GCC will work if it is version 3.4.0 or higher.

*Compilation*

The makefiles provided require GNU make.  They also assumes that the
compiler is called 'g++-3.4'.  To change this, or to change other
compilation options, edit the makefile src/GNUmakefile.

In order to compile the program on UNIX, simply enter the src/
directory and type 'make' at the shell prompt. This will produce an
executable called 'bali-phy'.

On windows, this may with in the cygwin environment, which emulates a
UNIX environment.

On MacOSX, this procedure may need to be modified slightly.  By using
the 'Fink' system, you can probably install GNU make.  In addition,
'jam' may work using the Jamfile provided.

*Other tools*

Sources for tools are in the src/tools directory.  The makefile is not
up-to-date for every tool.  However, try running e.g. "make
tools/model_P".
